Sending four attachments on WhatsApp creates confusion — parents miss a page, students open the wrong file in class, and print shops charge for sorting. One merged PDF is a single source of truth for the session.",

Mentr Merge PDF uses browser-side libraries so bytes never leave your device. You still get a downloadable combined file — without creating an account.",
